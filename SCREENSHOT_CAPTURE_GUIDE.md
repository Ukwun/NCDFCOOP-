### Post-Capture Processing
```
1. File Organization
   - Create folder: screenshots_v1.0.0/
   - Move all PNG files to folder
   - Verify file sizes (should be 2-5 MB each)
   - Backup original files (cloud or external drive)

2. Image Optimization (Optional)
   - Use tool: ImageMagick, TinyPNG, PNGQuant
   - Goal: Reduce file size 10-20% without quality loss
   - Command (ImageMagick):
     convert input.png -quality 85 output.png
   - Result: Faster PlayStore uploads

3. Quality Check
   - Open each PNG in image viewer
   - Verify:
     [ ] Image is sharp and clear
     [ ] Colors are accurate
     [ ] Text is readable
     [ ] No artifacts or compression issues
     [ ] Dimensions are correct (1080 × 1920)
     [ ] No sensitive data visible (phone numbers, etc.)
     [ ] Professional appearance

4. Final Naming & Organization
   - File structure:
     ```

     ├── 07_order_confirmation.png
     ├── 08_order_tracking.png
     └── README.txt
     ```
   - README.txt should list what each screenshot shows

5. Upload to PlayStore

## 16. TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON SCREENSHOT ISSUES

```
Issue: Text appears blurry or pixelated
Solution:
- Ensure emulator resolution is exactly 1080 × 1920
- Use Pixel 4a or similar device (1080 × 2340 for newer phones)
- Real device: Screenshot is sharp by default
- Check "Scale display" setting (should be automatic)

Issue: ProductImages not loading or showing placeholders
Solution:
- Ensure good WiFi connection
- Wait 5 seconds after navigating to screen
- Force reload: Pull-to-refresh (if available)
- Restart emulator/app if persistent
- Check Firebase connectivity in app

Issue: Ratings or member data not showing
Solution:
- Use test account with complete profile
- Add products to cart to create transaction history
- Check that Firebase is initialized (check logs)
- Ensure mock fallback data is available

Issue: "Add to Cart" button not visible (cut off)
Solution:
- Make sure screen height is 1920px (full height)
- Scroll up/down slightly to center the button
- Try different emulator: Pixel 5 (1960px height) may help
- Crop screenshot to exact 1920px if needed

Issue: Member loyalty card doesn't show member tier
Solution:
- Log in with an account that's actually a member
- Generate test data via Firebase Console
- Ensure member tier is set: Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum
- Check that Firestore has member role in auth claims

Issue: PlayStore says image dimensions invalid
Solution:
- Check file metadata: identify filename.png (ImageMagick)
- Must be exactly 1080 × 1920 px
- Re-export from original source if needed
- Use ImageMagick to verify/fix:
  identify 01_hero_home.png
  convert input.png -resize 1080x1920 output.png

Issue: Screenshot is too large or uploads slowly
Solution:
- Compress PNG: pngquant --quality 70-85 input.png
- Or use Online tool: tinypng.com, compressor.io
- Target: Keep under 2 MB per image
- 8 images × 2 MB = 16 MB total (well under PlayStore limit of 160 MB total)
```
