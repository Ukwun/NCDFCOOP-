4. **Background tasks** (notifications, sync)

### Lower Risk Items (Polish in weeks 4+)
1. UI animations
2. Advanced analytics
3. App shortcuts
4. Widget integration
5. Performance optimization

## SUPPORT QUICK REFERENCE

### Common Issues & Fixes

**"Firebase not initialized"**

**"Empty product list"**
- Solution: Firestore is empty or rules are blocking
